title: Hadoop Java MapReduce Examples
categories:

---
I've created a GitHub repository with Java MapReduce examples for Hadoop. Use the [hadoop-java-examples](https://github.com/baswenneker/hadoop-java-examples "GitHub repository") readme to get started. 

Here's a short outline which I'll update when new examples are added:

* SameTaste: basic MapReduce example.
* MapReduceChain: example showing how to chain MapReduce Jobs where a job uses the output of a completed job.
